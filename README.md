### Impact of Different Variants of COVID-19

&ensp; &ensp;&ensp; &ensp; In this part, we mainly explore the impact of different variants on comfirmed cases, deaths of different regions and different time.  
&ensp; &ensp;&ensp; &ensp;Also, the relation between the time difference of peak among regions and the origin of variants will be analyzed.

### Comparison between Different Regions

&ensp; &ensp;&ensp; &ensp;In this part, multiple dimentions will be considered, including continents, countries, degree of development, latitude, climate, vaccinations, policy responses.  

### COVID-19 LSTM

&ensp; &ensp;&ensp; &ensp;In this part, we will simulate and predict the epidemic situation through the LSTM model.

### COVID-19 SEIR

&ensp; &ensp;&ensp; &ensp;In this part, we will simulate and predict the epidemic situation through the SEIR model.
